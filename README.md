[00:00.08] (I know you so well, so well)
[00:06.63] (I mean, I can do anything that he can)
[00:13.43] (I've been pretty)
[00:22.43] 
[00:14.68] I know you're somewhere, somewhere
[00:21.26] I've been trapped in my mind, girl, just holding on
[00:27.92] I don't wanna pretend there's something, we're nothing
[00:35.37] I've been stuck thinking 'bout her, I can't hold back
[01:01.87] 
[00:43.12] I'm in pain, wanna put ten shots in my brain
[00:45.96] I've been tripping 'bout some things, can't change
[00:47.70] Suicidal, same time
[00:48.67] I'm tame, picture this, in bed, get a phone call
[01:12.67] 
[00:51.23] Girl that you fucked with killed herself
[00:53.06] That was this summer and nobody helped
[00:54.76] And ever since then, man, I hate myself
[00:56.31] Wanna fucking end it, pessimistic
[01:12.81] 
[00:58.29] All wanna see me with no pot to piss in
[00:59.93] But niggas been excited 'bout the grave I'm digging
[01:01.72] Having conversations about my haste decisions
[01:03.67] Fucking sickening
[01:12.17] 
[01:04.42] At the same time, memory surfaced through the grapevine
[01:06.83] 'Bout my uncle playing with a slipknot
[01:08.25] Post-Traumatic-Stress got me fucked up
[01:09.63] Been fucked up since a couple months they had a nigga locked up
[01:41.13] 
[01:11.09] I be feeling pain, I be feeling pain just to hold on
[01:18.09] And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb
[01:25.39] I be feeling pain, I be feeling pain just to hold on
[01:32.26] And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb
[01:51.26] 
[01:40.36] (I know you so well, I know you well)
[01:47.13] (I mean, I can do anything, I can do that he can)
[01:54.14] (I've been pretty, I know you so well)
